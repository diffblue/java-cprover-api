CProver Java API of JBMC
========================

This repository contains the sources for building a Java library
(`cprover.jar`) that allows access to the CProver API of the Java
model checking tool
[JBMC](https://github.com/diffblue/cbmc/tree/develop/jbmc).

This library exposes functionality such as _assume_ or _nondetInt_,
which are useful for modelling verification harnesses for
Java applications.
